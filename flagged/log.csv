We are living in a time, where a quality resource like this is available for free.
Vivek never fails to impress! Even with familiar concepts, his unique delivery keeps things fresh and insightful every time😊
The way all the core concepts got covered in such short span, without missing any nuance of the concept, reflects your genuine interest in teaching studentss and help them reach heightss...thankss a lot !!!❤
I love this so much !! 
He's talking about all the details of computer science 
this is missing in most of the colleges!!
Great session, Vivek bhaiya!! ❤🔥
Your explanations are easy to understand and always help me solidify my understanding. Thank you for making such high-quality educational content accessible to everyone.
Great session, especially the way you introduced operating systems, quite unique.
Best set of resources to go for 💯

A much needed video bhaiya❤️
The Core CS is must for engineers. Very well explained ✨

I still remember my last time Core CS preparation for college placements. Trust me guys, Vivek teaches you exactly what is being asked in the interviews. Your concepts are going to be clear. I still use his slides for quick revision.
Awesome❤
great bro
here before this blows up completely
Best 🎉
Az Institute coming soon 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice
which slide? Can you link me to it?
Awesome
bhaiya complete series continue krdo pls cs core fundamentals k lie
9:00 here, you could have shown the actual video feed?
bro white background mat rakha karo aakho mei dard hogaya
At 24:00, I think the assembly code generated would have been much smaller if only iostream would have been included.
Suggest where to learn OOPS  for interview

Bro if you hesitate speaking in english, then you should have conducted the session in hindi only. I couldn't understand most of the time what you were speaking.
Bro I like what you're doing here, but this is a long video so please time stamp all the major/minor parts of the video, it'll be easier for everyone and you'll attract more viewers and subscribers.
What you are showing up not visible properly .
Try to do it in a bigger screen.

Absolutely.
Absolutely... the more towards COA and Core you go... more of Electronics it becomes!
​ @vivekgupta3484  Well I get this doubt that learning into in-depth stuffs like assembly language and hardware programming, is also required to be known by a software engineer?? I generally found seniors going into depth core(especially in ECE or EE) study these things for a profile in digital hardware design or similar but for most of the software roles as a beginner, mainly everyone just keeps telling to have a very good grasp on DSA/CP and some basic projects mostly in web development(as goes in KGP these days).
So please mention anything you found from your experience is better to know before joining or applying for a role as a software developer/engineering intern.
 @sanketnaik387  That too is needed.., maybe not at full depth... but knowledge is needed for sure.
Absolutely... what is the AGI running on?
Zooms default sadly.
Great suggestion broo...but Bhai is not doing for views or subscribers... Agr woh krte na toh video ka tittle banta ""day in the life of a software engineer at google"" or ""this helped to get into Google "" or ""you need only x amount of question"" 😅
Pura dekho yaar.
Added time stamps :D
Next ZOOM recording me will replace.
